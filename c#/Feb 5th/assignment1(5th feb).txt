/*7.difference between ToIn16, ToInt32 , ToByte and other methods available
            The Convert.ToInt16() method returns the 16-bit integer e.g. short, the Convert.ToInt32() returns 32-bit integers e.g. int and the Convert.ToInt64() returns the 64-bit integer e.g. long. */

            /*8. What is System in the program. What are Console and Convert? What are Write, WriteLine , ReadLine and ToByte
            system  : system is a namespace, namespace is logical collection of related classes
            Console : Console is a class which is present in the namespace
            Write, WriteLine :The most common method to output something in C# is WriteLine() and Write().
                        The difference is that WriteLine() prints the output on a new line each time, while Write() prints on the same line
            Convert : this is used to convert one data type to other data type
            ReadLine : it is a input statement to take values
            ToByte : it is used to conver data into bytes */


            /*9. Is it mandatory to have a class in the project
              Yes, C# application must have at least one class with Main method, so that execution can begin from it.*/


            /*10. Why is static added to Main() method?
              A main method is static since it is available to run when the C# program starts. It is the entry point of the program and runs without even creating an instance of the class.*/
